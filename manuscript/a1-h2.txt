# H2 Database

*H2* ([project page](http://h2database.com), or
[on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2_%28DBMS%29)) is a SQL database implemented in Java
with couple of features that are very handy especially for testing:

* Firstly, H2 is all packed in a single JAR which weights way under 2 MB and contains features
you would not expect in such a cute packaging.
* It can store its tables both in-memory and on the disk. Using in-memory storage is great for
tests, because it's fast (for reasonable database size) and also naturally disappears after the
test is run.
* It supports both embedded mode -- running in-process with the application itself -- and
client-server mode where it can run standalone and you can connect to it from different process.
For automated tests I prefer embedded mode, but when I experiment I use client-server mode, so
I can check the state of my database independently from my demo application.
* It contains various tools -- most prominent of which is web-based SQL console. This is what
you can use to check the database in server mode while it's being modified by an application.
* Naturally, it contains JDBC driver.
* SQL support is rich enough to mimic much more evolved/expensive databases, I used it to test
JPA applications that were originally developed for Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server -- no changes
besides the JPA configuration were required.
* While it does not support any scripting (like Oracle's
[PL/SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/SQL) or PostgreSQL
[PL/pgSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/pgSQL)) you can plug triggers and procedures developed
in Java. Maybe I'd not use it if the database contained a lot of code, but when you need to handle
couple of simple procedures and some triggers, it can be done.

## Starting it

You can [download it](http://h2database.com/html/download.html) as a Windows Installer or
multi-platform ZIP, but all you really need is the JAR file. If you manage your application's
dependencies you probably have it somewhere on the disk already. So just locate it and run it.
If everything is set up properly, probably just hitting Enter on the JAR in some file manager will
do. If not, try a command:

{linenos=off}
  $ java -jar $HOME/.m2/repository/com/h2database/h2/1.4.190/h2-1.4.190.jar

Of course, adjust the JAR location and name, and if you don't have `java` on your `PATH` (yet!)
do something about it.
