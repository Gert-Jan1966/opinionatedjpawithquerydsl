# Status of the book

Where am I with the book and what are my plans? (All is subject to change, of course.)

To actually finish something, I want to do this in the 1st edition:
* Preface (30%) - to explain why this book even exists and some background
* Biggest gripes (0%) - where the JPA pains most and how I cope with it

Other ideas, maybe for next editions:
* filtering/pagination
You may be interested in presented filtering/pagination "framework" too and while it is utilized
with the JPA back-end in our case, the concept is rather generic. Sometimes I feel like reinventing
this part for every project I've made.
*

Talking about frameworks you may ask: "How does this all compare to Spring Data? It can be used
with JPA and Querydsl too!" ... TODO :-)
