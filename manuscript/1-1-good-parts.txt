# Good Parts

First we will look at all the goodies JPA offers to us. Why did I started to prefer JPA over
a particular provider? Mind that this part is just an extended enumeration of various features,
not a tutorial material.

The good parts are not absolute though. If you compare the JPA as a standard with a concrete ORM
there is one set of benefits and related drawbacks. Comparing JPA with SQL is not quite appropriate
as JPA covers much bigger stack. We may compare JPA with JDBC, or we may compare *Java Persistence
Query Language* (JPQL) with SQL to a degree.

TODO: Crucial benefit over JDBC and SQL


## JPA is standard

When we started with ORM, we picked Hibernate. There were not many other ORM options for Java, or
at least they were not both high-profile and free. Yet even Hibernate creators are now glad
when their tool is [used via JPA interfaces](http://www.theserverside.com/news/2240186700/The-JPA-20-EntityManager-vs-the-Hibernate-Session-Which-one-to-use):

Standard is not always necessarily good, but in case of JPA it is well established and respected.
Now you can choose between multiple *JPA 2.1* implementations or just deploy to any *Java EE 7*
application server. I'd not bet on the promise that you can easily swap one provider (or application
server) for the other -- my experiences are terrible in this aspect -- but there is common set
of annotations for mapping your entities, the same set of most important classes like
`EntityManager`.

But standards also have their drawbacks, most typically that they are some common subset of the
features offered in that area. JPA's success is probably based on the fact that it emerged as
rock-solid subset of features offered by major players in Java ORM world. But starting this way
it must have trailed behind them. *JPA 1* did not offer any criteria API, can you imagine that?
Now *JPA 2.1* is somewhere else. The features cover nearly anything you need for typical
applications talking to relational databases.

And even if something is missing, you may combine it with proprietary annotations of a particular
ORM provider -- but only to a necessary degree. And perhaps you can switch those to JPA in its next
version. In any case, JPA providers allow you to spice up JPA soup with their specifics easily.
That way JPA does not restrain you.


## Database independence

Let's face it - it's not possible to easily switch from one database to another when you have
invested in one -- especially if you use stored procedures or anything else beyond simple plain
SQL. But JPA is not the problem here, on the contrary. It will require much less (if any) changes
and the application will go on.

Also, if you just start another project and go for different database your application programmers
using JPA probably don't have to learn anything new. This cuts both ways though. I've heard that
"you don't have to learn SQL" is considered benefit of the JPA, but every time programmers didn't
understand SQL they didn't produce good results.


## Natural SQL-Java type mapping

JPA can persist anything that is so called *persistable type*. These are:

* entity classes (annotated with `@Entity`) -- these loosely matches database tables;
* mapped superclasses (`@MappedSuperclass`) -- when you map class hierarchies;
* embeddable classes (`@Embeddable`) -- to group multiple columns into a value object;

These were all types on class level, more or less matching whole database tables. Now we will
move to field level:

* simple Java types (optionally annotated with `@Basic`) like primitive types, their wrappers,
`String`, `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`;
* temporal types like `java.util.Date/Calendar` in addition to types from `java.sql` package;
* collections -- these might be relations to other entities or embeddable types;
* enum types -- here you can choose whether it's persisted by its `name()` or by `ordinal()`.

We can't reasonably compare the first part of the list with JDBC, because the principles are
completely different. JDBC works on low relational level only. But we can compare how easy it is
to get the value for any column as your preferred type. Here JDBC
locks you to low level types without any good conversion capabilities, not even for omnipresent
types like `java.util.Date`. In JPA you can declare field as `java.util.Date` and just say that
the column represents time, date or timestamp using `@Temporal` annotation. I feel no need to use
`java.sql` package anymore.

Also enums are much easier, although this applies only for simple cases, not to mention that for
evolving enums `@Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)` is not an option (it should not be an option at all,
actually).

The bottom line is that mapping from SQL types to Java field types is much more natural with JDBC.
And we haven't even mentioned two big guns JPA offers -- custom type converters and large object
support.


### Convenient type conversion

Up to *JPA 2.0* you could not define custom conversions, but *JPA 2.1* changed this. Now you can
simply annotate your field with `@Convert` and implement `AttributeConverter<X, Y>` with two
very obvious methods:

* `Y convertToDatabaseColumn (X attribute)`
* `X convertToEntityAttribute (Y dbData)`

And you're done! Of course, don't forget to add annotation `@Converter` on the converter itself
so it's picked up with auto-scan.

TODO: is it necessary if it is in `persistence.xml`?

Even better, you can declare converter as `@Converter(autoApply = true)` and you can do without
`@Convert` on the field. This is extremely handy for `java.time` types, because *JPA 2.1* does not
support those (it was released before *Java SE 8*, remember).


### Large objects

Compared with JDBC, the JPA makes working with large objects (like SQL `CLOB` and `BLOB` types) a breeze.
Just annotate the field with `@Lob` and use proper type, that is `byte[]` for *BLOBs* and `String`
for CLOBs. You may also use `Byte[]` (can't imagine why) or `Serializable` for *BLOBs* and `char[]`
or `Character[]` for *CLOBs*.

In theory you may annotate the `@Lob` field as `@Basic(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)` however this is
a mere hint to the JPA provider and you can bet it will not be heard out. More about lazy on
basic and *to-one* fields in a [dedicated section](#lazy-problems).

Getting LOBs via JDBC from some databases may not be such a big deal, but if you ever looped
over LOB content using 4 KB buffer you will appreciate straightforward JPA mapping.


## Flexible mapping

It better be flexible because it is the most important reason for the whole ORM concept.
Field-to-column mapping can specified as annotations on the fields or on the getters -- or
in XML files. Annotation placement implies access strategy, but it can be overridden using
`@Access` on the class. In the book I'll use field access mostly, but property access can be
handy when you want to do something in get/setters. For instance, before *JPA 2.1* we did simple
conversions there, field was already converted and we used additional get/setters annotated as
`@Transient` leaving those JPA related accessors only for JPA purposes.

Mentioning `@Transient` -- sometimes you want additional fields in your JPA entities and this
clearly tells JPA not to touch them. There are arguments how much or little should be in JPA
entity, I personally prefer rather less than more -- this on the other hand is criticized
as [anemic domain model](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html), but the
question is whether JPA entities really are "domain model" and not just part of the "data mapper"
layer. With all the annotation mapping it actually serves its purpose already (is it its single
responsibility? I guess so), which then leads other people to an argument for XML mapping that
just makes it all more foggy. In any case, this topic is not covered in this book.


## Unit of work

[Unit of work](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html) is a pattern described in
[[PoEAA](#bib-poeaa)]. In Hibernate it was represented by its `Session`, in JPA more descriptive
(and arguably more EE-ish) name `EntityManager` was chosen. To make things just a little tougher
on newcomers, entity manager manages something called *persistence context* -- but you make
no big mistake if you treat *entity manager* and *persistence context* as synonyms. Nowadays
`EntityManager` is typically injected where needed, and combined with declarative transactions
it is very natural to use it. Funny enough, it's not injected with standard `@Inject` but with
`@PersistenceContext`.

To explain the pattern simply: Whatever you read or delete through it or whatever new you persist
with it will be "flushed" at the end of transaction and relevant SQL queries will get executed.
If the mapping is good enough then the right order of insert/delete is determined. But sometimes
it needs explicit help from the programmer -- which is allowed.

You get all the goodies you need from `EntityManager` and while there is some ideal way how to use
it, it is flexible enough and can be "bent". You can flush things earlier if you need to force some
order of SQL statements, etc.

Because *unit of work* remembers all the work related to it sometimes it is called "session cache"
or "1^st^ level cache". This "cache" however does not survive the unit of work itself and talking
about cache gives this pattern additional -- and confusing -- meaning.

After all the years of experience with `Session` and `EntityManager` it was actually really
refreshing to read about *unit of work* pattern, especially how it was written back in 2002.
To see what operations are typical for it, to have it explicitly stated and also to read Fowler's
speculation how it will be used and implemented. (Most of them are still valid!)


## Declarative transactions

JPA has basic transactional support, but when it comes to declarative transactions they are part of
Java Transaction API (JTA). JPA and JTA are seamlessly integrated from programmer's point of view
that we simply take `@Transactional` support for granted.
