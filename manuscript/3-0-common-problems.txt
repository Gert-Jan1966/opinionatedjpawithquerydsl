-# Common problems {#part-common-problems}

After the previous part this one will be more relaxed. We will talk about couple of typical
problems related to the use of ORM/JPA, some of them stemming from the underlying relational
model. We will try to load our data in an appropriate manner, avoiding executing many unnecessary
statements or adding superfluous joins where possible.

Finally we will wrap it all with more advanced Querydsl topics.

Unlike in the previous part there is no recommended order of the chapters and you can read any
of them as you like.
