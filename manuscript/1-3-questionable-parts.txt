# Questionable parts

* TODO: is it assured that `@Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` has id filled in
after insert? in case of EclipseLink it happens after fetch (IIRC), Hibernate does it sooner(?)
* unit-of-work works only with whole entities, it does not emit partial updates

## Lazy on basic and *to-one* fields {#lazy-problems}

## Unit of work vs queries

## 2^nd^ level cache vs queries

TODO: In projpa2 called "in-memory cache", but also "second-level cache" when talking about EMF.getCache()

### Let database to cache it all?

## You can't escape SQL and relation model

TODO: Example: Paging with to-many fetching
