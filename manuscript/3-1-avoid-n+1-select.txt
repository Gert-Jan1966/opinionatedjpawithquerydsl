# Avoid N+1 select {#ch-avoid-n-plus-1}

While performance tuning is not the main goal of this book we should follow some elementary
performance common sense. If we can avoid an unnecessary query we should do so. With ORM/JPA
we can generate a lot of needless queries without even realizing. In this chapter we will cover
the most pronounced problem called *N+1 select*.

## Anatomy of N+1 select

I'd prefer to call this problem 1+N because it mostly starts with one query that returns N rows
and induces N additional queries. While addition is commutative -- hence 1+N is the same like N+1
-- I'll stick to *N+1* as usually used in literature. The typical scenarios when the N+1 problem
appears are:

* Query for N entities that have eager *to-one* relationship -- or more of them -- and the provider
is not smart enough to use joins.
* Query for N entities that have eager *to-many* relationship and the provider is either not smart
enough to use the join (again) or it is not possible to use it for other reasons like pagination.
We will cover paginating of entities with *to-many* [later in this chapter](#to-many-paginating).
* Query for N entities later with lazy relationship that is triggered later, e.g. in the view as
usual with open-session-in-view (OSIV) pattern.

There are probably more scenarios, but these are the most typical ones. First let's look at the
eager examples.


### Eager *to-one* without joins

If you recall our [simple example with `@ManyToOne`](#many-to-one-simple-example) from the chapter
[Troubles with *to-one* relationships](#ch-to-one-troubles) you know that *to-one* relationships
may trigger additional fetching. These may result in DB queries or they can be found in the
cache -- depends on your setting -- and this all must be taken into consideration.

For the next sections let's use the following data for dogs and their owners:

{title="Content of **Owner** table", width="narrow"}
| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1 | Adam |
| 2 | Charlie |
| 3 | Joe |
| 4 | Mike |

{title="Content of **Dog** table", width="narrow"}
| id | name | owner_id |
|----|------|-----|----------|
| 1 | Alan | 1 (Adam) |
| 2 | Beastie | 1 (Adam) |
| 3 | Cessna | 1 (Adam) |
| 4 | Rex | 3 (Joe) |
| 5 | Lessie | 4 (Mike) |
| 6 | Dunco | 4 (Mike) |
| 7 | Goro | `NULL` |

Our mapping for the `Dog` looks like this:

~~~
@Entity
public class Dog {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Integer id;

  private String name;

  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
  @JoinColumn(name = "owner_id")
  private Owner owner;
~~~

And for the `Owner`:

~~~
@Entity
public class Owner implements Serializable {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Integer id;

  private String name;

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
  private Set<Dog> dogs;
~~~

Now let's list all the dogs with this code:

~~~
List<Dog> dogs = new JPAQuery<>(em)
  .select(QDog.dog)
  .from(QDog.dog)
  .fetch();
~~~

We get seven dogs for three different owners (one dog is not owned) but what happened on the SQL
level? Both Hibernate and EclipseLink do something like this (output from EclipseLink):

~~~
SELECT ID, NAME, OWNER_ID FROM DOG
SELECT ID, NAME FROM OWNER WHERE (ID = 1)
SELECT ID, NAME FROM OWNER WHERE (ID = 3)
SELECT ID, NAME FROM OWNER WHERE (ID = 4)
~~~

That classifies as N+1 problem, although the N may be lower than the count of
selected rows thanks to the persistence context. 

TODO: EclipseLink can be coerced with `@JoinFetch(JoinFetchType.OUTER)` (worked for me),
Hibernate with `@Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN)` (surprisingly didn't work).

Of course, we can write query with the same join in the first place. It doesn't take advantage
of any cached results but at least we say exactly what we want. With any further *to-one*
relationships you may want to use lazy fetch for the data you don't need (and you know you can
rely on `LAZY`) or try some other technique described in [Troubles with *to-one*
relationships](#ch-to-one-troubles) (entity views come to mind, but projections are even better).

### Lazy relationships triggered later

## Paginating with *to-many* {#to-many-paginating}

I mentioned previously that we [can't escape SQL](#cant-escape-sql) underneath.

TODO bigger example, some table picture, then solution

Possible pure SQL solution where we only paginate over the table we need to -- but this requires
subquery in from:

~~~

(6 rows, 0 ms)

-- good
select * from (select * from owner limit 2 offset 2) o left join dog d on o.id=d.owner_id ;
ID  	NAME  	ID  	NAME  	BREED  	OWNER_ID  
3	Joe	6	Rex	null	3
4	Mike	7	Lessie	null	4
4	Mike	8	Dunco	null	4
(3 rows, 0 ms)

-- wrong
select * from owner o left join dog d on o.id=d.owner_id limit 2 offset 2;
ID  	NAME  	ID  	NAME  	BREED  	OWNER_ID  
1	Adam	5	Cessna	null	1
2	Charlie	null	null	null	null
