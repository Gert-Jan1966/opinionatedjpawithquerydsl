# Avoid N+1 select {#ch-avoid-n-plus-1}

While performance tuning is not the main goal of this book we should follow some elementary
performance common sense. If we can avoid an unnecessary query we should do so. With ORM/JPA
we can generate a lot of needless queries without even realizing. In this chapter we will cover
the most pronounced problem called *N+1 select*.

## Anatomy of N+1 select

I'd prefer to call this problem 1+N because it mostly starts with one query that returns N rows
and induces N additional queries. While addition is commutative -- hence 1+N is the same like N+1
-- I'll stick to *N+1* as usually used in literature. The typical scenarios when the N+1 problem
appears are:

* Query for N entities that have eager *to-one* relationship -- or more of them -- and the provider
is not smart enough to use joins.
* Query for N entities that have eager *to-many* relationship and the provider is either not smart
enough to use the join (again) or it is not possible to use it for other reasons like pagination.
We will cover paginating of entities with *to-many* [later in this chapter](#to-many-paginating).
* Query for N entities later with lazy relationship that is triggered later, e.g. in the view as
usual with open-session-in-view (OSIV) pattern.

There are probably more scenarios, but these are the most typical ones. First let's look at the
eager examples.

I mentioned previously that we [can't escape SQL](#cant-escape-sql) underneath.
