-# Final thoughts {#part-final-thoughts}

So here we are after the ride through highs and lows of JPA with some bits of common sense advices.
Story wasn't that good, probably, because -- at least for me -- it culminated quite soon around
the troubles with *to-one* relationships, not to mention that my proposed solution is not pure JPA.

Would I use JPA or ORM again? Voluntarily? Yes -- especially for simple cases. This is a paradox
-- and a problem too. Firstly, ORM ideas were developed mostly to help us with rich domain models.
Using it for simple systems and domains you pay the cost of a technology intended for complex
domains. But from my experience ORM gets unwieldy for larger domains, especially if you don't use
domain-driven design (which I admit never saw in proper practice). But even DDD proponent, Eric
Evans, lately admitted that proper DDD may be easier with systems where context boundaries are not
only logical, but also physical -- like microservices. I agree, because implicit is never as solid
as explicit, as I often stressed in this book. (We may as well agree that many implicit and
automagic solutions make our live actually easier. But this must be supported by knowledge. When
people maintaining the system change and new ones don't understand those implicit parts all the
benefits are gone.)

Will I use ORM on bigger systems? Probably, as I don't design every system I work on. Would I try
something else if I could? Definitely. TODO
