TODO: Describe the overal concept - going less ORM, more "raw" :-), with FKs as values,
not relations and utilizing ON clause (new in JPA 2.1) to join these when necessary.

Investigate more about Entity Graphs:

Also projpa2, p.321

However, I doubt this tackles the problem of inherently eager to-one mappings.
