# Moving away from to-one relationships

Full-blown object-relational mapping maps database foreign keys as relations between objects.
Instead of `Integer breedId` you have `Breed breed` where mapping information provides all the
necessary low-level information about the foreign key (annotations or XML). This can be done in
any direction (even in reverse), for one or both directions (then you choose which one is the
owner's side, which is kinda more "in control" of the relationship) and in any cardinality (with
annotations `@OneOnOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne` and `@ManyToMany`). This is probably the most
pronounced feature of ORM.

And I'm going to make a case against some of it.
