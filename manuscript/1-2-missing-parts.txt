# The Missing Parts

In this part we'll go through things that are missing in *Java Persistence Query Language* (JPQL)
when compared to SQL.


* no support for right-outer-join
* TODO: what does this mean?
support for left-outer-join only if the relation in the entities is in the same direction
* no support for subquery neither in SELECT nor in FROM clauses

The best way how to find corner cases that are not supported in the specification is simply to
search for "not supported".
