# The Missing Parts

In this part we'll go through things that are missing in *Java Persistence Query Language* (JPQL)

* no support for right-outer-join
* TODO: what does this mean?
support for left-outer-join only if the relation in the entities is in the same direction
* no support for subquery neither in SELECT nor in FROM clauses
